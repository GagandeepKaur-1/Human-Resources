# Human-Resources

Two datasets were given - hr_train.csv and hr_test.csv . The main objective to do the modelling  and prediction was to predict which valuable employee will leave next. The big question here was “ Why are our best and most experienced employees leaving prematurely?”Data hr_train was to be used to build predictive model for response variable ‘left’. Predictone were to be made using the model developed submissions were to be made in a csv files. Use this database and try to predict which valuable employees will leave next. Fields in the dataset included: Employee satisfaction level, Time spent at the company and Whether they have had a promotion in the last 5 years. 

	Solution: A good model was created using the ML Algorithm Stacking. Auc score was the evaluation criteria. A good score (0.74) was obtained after developing the model and making correct predictions.
